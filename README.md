# adopt-pethub
Repository dedicated for future ETEC's TCC

## Go version
We use golang v1.21, so please, make sure this is the version you download and install.

## Docker
You can run docker-compose up -d in order to start this application.

But you can also run `go run backend/main/main.go` locally and test if DB connection and http server are working as expected.
